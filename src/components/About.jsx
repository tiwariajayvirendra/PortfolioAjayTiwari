        <p>
          Hii Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold text-blue-700">Tiwari Ajay Virendra</span>, a BCA student and Fullstack Web Developer with a deep love for scalable systems and clean UI. My journey began with curiosity and evolved into crafting production-ready MERN stack applications that empower users and interns alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in building responsive, modular, and performant web apps using <span className="font-semibold">MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js</span>, styled with <span className="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span>. Every line of code I write is designed to be teachable, reusable, and onboarding-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the tech, I believe in legacy-driven developmentâ€”creating utilities, documentation, and workflows that help future developers thrive. Whether itâ€™s scripting recovery tools, designing UI layouts, or mentoring interns, I bring clarity, empathy, and a growth mindset to every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mission is simple: <span className="italic">to make modern web development accessible, scalable, and deeply human.</span> Letâ€™s build systems that teach, empower, and endure.
